# Footsteps


A children's game.  Teach your kids programming skills before they can read.


I looked for good resources for teaching young kids.  There's very little out there for kids in Kindergarten or first grade.  So I wrote my own.


Basic skills they will practice:
* You don't tell it what you want, you tell it how to get there.
* You tell it all of the steps before you ask to see the result.
* If you make a mistake you don't have to start from scratch.
* And we try to use normal Windows controls as much as possible.


So it’s a lot like real programming, but it’s within reach of young children.
